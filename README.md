Anylysing the US baby names Data.

In this Notebook I implemented my different knowledge to analyze the data of all the babies born in the United States for over 100 years.

I was able to design, implement and present different types of visualization based on the stipulated data.

Also based on my own curiosity to the names of known people. I have been able to investigate and graph their change over time. In this Notebook it is possible to group different daatasets together into a single one. As well as solving different Challenges that were presented and demonstrated in the document.
